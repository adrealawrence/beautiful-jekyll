I am an education historian.  Most of my colleagues know me as someone who has studied American Indian histories and their corresponding education histories.  After studying this field for a number of years, and having tinkered with a variety of different digital and analog platforms, I am increasingly interested in how people think about their past and their relationships to their own pasts and those of people with whom they are connected.  This means that I am looking at established patterns across various popular corpora as well as gaps in those same bodies of literature that, in hindsight, should not be there based on individuals' and groups' experiences.  I am interested in learning, how it manifests as education, and how it continues to beget itself in social environments.  This means that I'm very curious about how researchers approach their studies, and I'm interested in how people have discerned meaning and figured out different ways to live in their worlds.  There are many ways of doing so.
